# verum visu Analyzer

The **verum visu Audio Visualization Toolkit** is a response to the idea that an open-source community can develop rich audio visualizations if the software is split up into a clearly defined, accessible process.

The toolkit will consist of three tools:

1. **Analyzer** *(this repo)*
analyzes audio for frequency data

2. **Processing**
algorithms/neural networks create visualization data from the frequency data as input

3. **Renderer + Video Output**
draw the visualization data in some way and creates a video file with the frames


Everything is at an extremely early stage!
